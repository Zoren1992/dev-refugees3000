## Project Background
This web application is designed for a programmer/developer to ask questions about multiple languages and other users can join to answer those specific questions about any problems or issues that can arise in the ever evolving world of code.
## What can "Dev-Refugee" do?
Dev-Refugee, it is a Q&A community that allows programmer/developer to create chat rooms and invite their friends to work on a problem. Users can view the Q&A records of all rooms and the most recently active rooms. Host can update and delete room informations. Rooms can be categorized based on different code languages. This also allows for other anonymous users to be able to join a chat room and help with the current problem the main user may have. Incase of any problems the main user of the room could arise from anonymous users, they will have the ability to detain that and remove any harmful/intolerant messages unrelated to the problem.
Thus, Dev-Refugee is the best place for you to have a safe and easily accessible chat rooms where you can solve problems with other users as programmers/developers.
